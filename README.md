# DecodeSCCMCollectionVariables
Decode SCCM collection variables from CCM_CollectionVariable class in the ConfigMgr client WMI namespaces. I needed this functionality in a simple PowerShell script, so this is my implementation of that.

Roger Zander had initially implemented code similar to this in his [CollVarProvider](https://gallery.technet.microsoft.com/ConfigMgr-Collection-1650d5bc), as well as the [Client Center for ConfigMgr](https://github.com/rzander/sccmclictr). Both are fantastic projects and I recommend them to any SCCM administrator.
